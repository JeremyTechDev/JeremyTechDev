## Hi, I'm Jeremy 👋

Full-Stack Software Engineer curious enough to keep learning everyday. I most active on my Twitter account at [@AskJere](https://twitter.com/askjere) so feel free to go check my profile and what I do there.

I recently opened my personal blogs app called [Tsseract](http://tsseract.askjere.com), go give a look at what I am writing to help the community learn from my experience.

If you wanna know more about me, you can also check my [portfolio](https://askjere.com). I am always happy to help of simple open a conversation. You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/askjere/) or just send a DM over Twitter.
