## Hi there, I'm Jeremy 👋

I am a young passionate software developer who is always trying to learn something new. My main goal is to develop a piece of software that helps people solve issues that are too common on earth 🌎: from paying excessively high student 👩‍🎓👨‍🎓 loans or just making your way in the world of music 🎹. 

I am also trying (just starting) to build a community [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AskJere). I think that a good developer is one who helps others write good code 🙌. That's is what I am trying to do by tweeting consistently.

In my free time, when I am not coding, I will probably be reading (I'm a Potterhead ⚡️👦), teaching English to kids 👨‍🏫, training my body 🏋️‍♂️, or hanging out with friends 🤙. Those to know me best say that I should also try to stand up comedy , but I think I have already found my place telling the computer what to do for me.

### Here is my development toolkit 👨‍💻
